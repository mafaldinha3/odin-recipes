<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This chaffles recipe makes low-carb waffles that can be used in so many ways. You can change the texture by adding some almond or coconut flour, turn them into sandwiches, modify them into a dessert, change the flavor by using different cheese, etc. </p>
<p>This is a basic chaffle, and it's delicious for breakfast with a pat of butter and a drizzle of sugar-free syrup.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>Â½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a waffle maker.</li>
    <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl; stir in mozzarella cheese until batter is well combined.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the preheated waffle maker, spreading it out from the center with a spoon. Close the waffle maker and cook until steaming stops and chaffle is well-browned, about 3 minutes. Don't overcook, as that will make it chewy. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
</ol>
